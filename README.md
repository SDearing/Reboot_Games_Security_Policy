# Reboot Games Security Policy
## 1.0 Introduction
### 1.1 Policy Overview
This documentation outlines the approaches that Reboot Games will follow to ensure the security of our systems and network. Within this documentation are the risks that our organisation will face and the procedures we take to ensure that our security remains robust against any threats.
### 1.2 Business Overview
Reboot Games is a game design and development organisation, which focuses primarily on the remastering of 'retro' games to a modern format. Reboot Games also works as a freelance organisation to proceed in software development for any hiring companies.
### 1.3 Business Structure
Reboot Games comprises of two owners and thirteen employees. All employees have ths same level access, this means that we all have access to the office and the hardware and software needed for us to complete our projects. The owners of reboot games oversee the devlopment of all projects and have access to admin privileges on the network. 
### 1.4 Hardware used
Reboot games uses high spec windows PCs in order to ensure that development is effecient and the software runs at top performance. The office has 21 PCs, 20 PCs for employees and 1 for the current owner present that day. We have extra PCs so if one system breaks the employee can use another to ensure that development is not slowed down. Below are the specs for each PC:
* Operating system: Windows 10 Enterprise 2016 LTSB
* OS Version: 1607
* Graphics Card: NVDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB
* RAM: 16GB
* Processor: Intel Core i7-7700 CPU @ 3.60GHz
* System: 64-bit operating system, x64 based processor
### 1.5 Software Used
To develop our games and projects we need to use certain software, for coding and designing visuals. Below are the types of software we mainly use to complete our projects:
* Unity: A game engine we use to develop our games
* Visual Studio Professional 2017: An IDE where we complete the main bulk of our coding
* Adobe Photoshop: Used to create any assets to be used in projects
## 2.0 Risks to the Organisation
### 2.1 Types of Security Risks
An organisation's network is vital for employees to be able to do their jobs and therefore make money for the company. For this reason it is imperative that our organisation is aware of what IT security risks it is vunerable to and how to deal with said security risks effectively.

#### Spam/Phishing
Employees in organisations use emails constantly to communicate with colleagues. A increasing threat to email users is spam with research even claiming that up to 94% of all emails are spam. Spam is more than just irritating, it can also be harmful: such as spam which includes malicious links, which downloads malware or other harmful files, when clicked on. Spam with malicious links are called phishing emails as they are designed to trick the user into clicking links that could harm their systems.Therefore the first step for a robust security is to make sure there is anti-spam software on the network.

#### Viruses
Another threat our organisation can face are viruses. A virus can copy itself and infect other machines on a network without the users even realising it's there until it strikes. Viruses can also be spread by email, instant messaging, and over shared networks which can lead to multiple work stations being effected by the virus, which can lead to a cycle of problems for the organisation. Viruses can also capture keystrokes which would lead to massive security risks, such as passwords and bank details being tracked. To counter this risk it would be very beneficial for an organisation to implement anti-virus software to protect their network.

#### Malware
Another threat to our organisation is malware. Malware refers to a variety of malicious software such as Trojans, worms and spyware which can inflitrate a work station without the worker realising. Like a virus, malware can also spread through a network by attaching itself to executable files and therefore causing an IT emergency on the network. while some malware is designed to just disrupt a system, some creators of malware use them for financial gain. Spyware, botnets and keystroke loggers can be used to control infected sytems to continue an attack on a organisation. They can also be used to track users login details and any credit card details being entered to buy something online, which can allow the creator of the malware to steal others private information. As an attempt to reduce this risk, an organisation should ensure that their anti-virus software it up to date and also check systems regularly to check for malicious files.

#### Data Loss/Theft
Data loss is when data cannot be accessed anymore by the company; because it has been lost, stolen, deleted or corrupted. If data is lost, it means that we will have to go back in the development process and re-create the lost data which would slow the development process significantly. If data is stolen it can be very beneficial to the thief as they could sell our data to other rivaling companies for financial gain.
## 3.0 Organisational Security Procedures
### Acceptable Use Procedures
Employees of Reboot Games will be given training on Reboot Game's security policy and their obligations to protect sensitive data of the oragnisation from unauthorized access. All employees will follow these guidelines as a condition of their employment and all employees and third parties who are granted privileges will be required to sign a document, stating that they have been given and read our security policy and have agreed to follow all the steps within it.
### Entering and Leaving Procedure
All employees of Reboot Games will be given a ID card, this ID card will allow the employee into the college where the Reboot Game's office resides, and will allow the employee to access the locked door into the office. All employees will be required to scan their ID upon entering the college and entering the office, to keep track of which employees are present and which are absent. All employees will also be required to scan out of the office and college when leaving, to keep track of who is still inside the building and therefore still has access to Reboot Game's office.
### Awareness Procedure
Upon seeing suspicious activity within the college grounds, an employee should immediately contact either a higher member of staff or security depending on what is most effecient. If the suspicious activity is deemed a threat all employees should evacuate the building using the nearest available exits. Employees are not allowed to re-enter the building until authorities have deemed the building safe again.
## 4.0 Potential Impact of Incorrect Configurations
### 4.1 Firewall Policies
Firewalls are an essential part to the a networks security, protecting the network from any malicious attackers or viruses. For this reason it is vital the firewall be configured properly or then the company would be vulnerable to attacks. A incorrect configuration of the firewall could lead to a flaw in the firewall a hacker could exploit to send malware through the firewall, if the malware gets through it could then effect a multitude of work stations which could lead to an IT emergency and prevent employees from getting work completed, or even steal employees personal information putting their other accounts at risk of hacks.
### 4.2 Third Party VPNs
A VPN or Virtual Private Network protects data while it is being shared on a public network (the internet). A third party VPN protects files coming from a companies network (like Reboot Games). If a third party VPN is not correctly configured it could lead to any data being sent outside the network, being intercepted and corrupted or even worse stolen. This would be a huge issue for Reboot Games as it could mean the loss of hours workload, for this reason third party VPNs need to be properly conifgured before any data can be sent outside the network.
## 5.0 Methods to Improve Network Security
### 5.1 DMZ
DMZ stands for Demilitarized Zone, which in terms of networking is a sub-network that can be used to seperate a private/local network from a public one. The DMZ itself is able to be accessed from the internet, however the local network itself cannot be accessed from any public network.

A DMZ is a useful security tool as it can cut off a private network from the internet. This is a very effective tool at reducing the risk of attacks from online hackers, as they can't access data stores belonging to that network through the internet. Network services that work through the internet, such as emails, can be placed inside the DMZ incase of a attack on the network, so hackers cannot access any of the data from that service.
### 5.2 Static IP
A static internet protocol (IP) is a number permantely assigned to that machine on a network, to establish its location on the internet. Every system on the internet has a dynamic IP but a system with a static IP is assigned manually by an internet service provider, a dynamic IP will change every time that system re-connects to the internet however a static IP will never change. A static IP is useful as it allows a network to apply more tasks to a system, such as hosting a website that would require a static IP so other systems can find it on the internet.
### 5.3 NAT
NAT stands for Network Address Translation which is the virtualisation of IP addresses on a network. NAT allows an organisation to require less IP addresses for their systems on their network. The NAT does this by translating the IP addresses of systems on a local network to one IP address, which is used by the router to connect the systems to the internet. Using a NAT provides an organisation with extra security as when a external system attempts to access a system on the local network, they will only find the IP of the router. 
## 6.0 Risk Assessment Procedures
|Risk           | Explanation               | Severity     |Procedure of Prevention                  |
|---------------|---------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Physical data theft    | An attacker breaking into and stealing data from the company, either for monetary gain or blackmail.| High | The last person to leave the office must make sure the door is locked, with an alarm set in place incase of a break in. Also all computer systems must be password protected.|
| Attempted Hack| A hacker attempts to break into the college network, with the purpose of stealing data from the network| High | The network must be protected with robust firewalls and the network must be tested, regularly, for possible vulnerabilties.|
| Illness| An employee spreading an illness around the office| Low | If an employee has an infectious illness, that employee should not go into the office until they are no longer inflicted with the illness.|
| Power cut | The college, which the office resides in, losing all power causing our computer systems to shut down potentially losing progress on tasks being worked on at that time | Medium | All work should be saved regularly, to avoid data loss if a power cut does occur|

## 7.0 Data Protection Processes and Regulations
Reboot Games must assure the protection of personal data, so it abides the regulations of the Data Protection Act 1998. The Data Protection Act was implemented into the law to assure that an indivduals personal information is not used for malicious use, i.e. identity theft. Reboot Games must assure this protection by making sure any personal data is kept secure and can only be accessed by the person(s) that data is related to.

The data protection act classifies personal data as information that can be used to indentify an individual either directly or indirectly. Such information includes: name, an identification number (i.e. National Insurance Number), location data, online identifiers and any reference to the individuals physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.
### Procedures by Reboot Games to Uphold the Data Protection Act
* Physical copies of personal data must be kept in a locked container at all times
* Once they have given their written consent, personal data must be taken from the individual in a private setting and may only be seen and handled by authorized personnel
* All copies of the individuals personal data must be destroyed as soon as they are no longer needed
* Employees must change their password(s) every month
* Any systems containing personal data must have said data encrypted and have up-to-date anti-virus software installed at all times.
