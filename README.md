Reboot Games comprises of two owners and thirteen employees. All employees have ths same level access, this means that we all have access to the office and the hardware and software needed for us to complete our projects. The owners of reboot games oversee the devlopment of all projects and have access to admin privileges on the network. 
### 1.4 Hardware used
Reboot games uses high spec windows PCs in order to ensure that development is effecient and the software runs at top performance. The office has 21 PCs, 20 PCs for employees and 1 for the current owner present that day. We have extra PCs so if one system breaks the employee can use another to ensure that development is not slowed down. Below are the specs for each PC:
* Operating system: Windows 10 Enterprise 2016 LTSB
* OS Version: 1607
* Graphics Card: NVDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB
* RAM: 16GB

### 1.5 Software Used
To develop our games and projects we need to use certain software, for coding and designing visuals. Below are the types of software we mainly use to complete our projects:
* Unity: A game engine we use to develop our games
* Visual Studio Professional 2017: An IDE where we complete the main bulk of our coding
* Adobe Photoshop: Used to create any assets to be used in projects
## 2.0 Risks to the Organisation
### 2.1 Types of Security Risks
An organisation's network is vital for employees to be able to do their jobs and therefore make money for the company. For this reason it is imperative that our organisation is aware of what IT security risks it is vunerable to and how to deal with said security risks effectively.

#### Spam/Phishing
Employees in organisations use emails constantly to communicate with colleagues. A increasing threat to email users is spam with research even claiming that up to 94% of all emails are spam. Spam is more than just irritating, it can also be harmful: such as spam which includes malicious links, which downloads malware or other harmful files, when clicked on. Spam with malicious links are called phishing emails as they are designed to trick the user into clicking links that could harm their systems.Therefore the first step for a robust security is to make sure there is anti-spam software on the network.

#### Viruses
Another threat our organisation can face are viruses. A virus can copy itself and infect other machines on a network without the users even realising it's there until it strikes. Viruses can also be spread by email, instant messaging, and over shared networks which can lead to multiple work stations being effected by the virus, which can lead to a cycle of problems for the organisation. Viruses can also capture keystrokes which would lead to massive security risks, such as passwords and bank details being tracked. To counter this risk it would be very beneficial for an organisation to implement anti-virus software to protect their network.

#### Malware
Another threat to our organisation is malware. Malware refers to a variety of malicious software such as Trojans, worms and spyware which can inflitrate a work station without the worker realising. Like a virus, malware can also spread through a network by attaching itself to executable files and therefore causing an IT emergency on the network. while some malware is designed to just disrupt a system, some creators of malware use them for financial gain. Spyware, botnets and keystroke loggers can be used to control infected sytems to continue an attack on a organisation. They can also be used to track users login details and any credit card details being entered to buy something online, which can allow the creator of the malware to steal others private information. As an attempt to reduce this risk, an organisation should ensure that their anti-virus software it up to date and also check systems regularly to check for malicious files.

#### Data Loss/Theft
Data loss is when data cannot be accessed anymore by the company; because it has been lost, stolen, deleted or corrupted. If data is lost, it means that we will have to go back in the development process and re-create the lost data which would slow the development process significantly. If data is stolen it can be very beneficial to the thief as they could sell our data to other rivaling companies for financial gain.
